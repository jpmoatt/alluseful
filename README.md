## 📖 Overview

`alluseful` is my personal package housing useful functions and addins,
as well as custom themes for RStudio and font installs. Most of these
features have been developed to simplify and standardise my ways of
working. Some of the functions here have been developed for wider use
and are included in the package
[fssetup](https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/fssetup).
