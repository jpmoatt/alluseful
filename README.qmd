## üìñ Overview

`alluseful` is my personal package, created to contain all the useful elements 
 I need for effective coding. It contains functions to set up my RStudio IDE how I like,
 personalised themes, editor fonts, templates for scripts, packages etc. 

Some of the functions here have been developed for wider use and are included in the package [fssetup](https://github.com/Defra-Data-Science-Centre-of-Excellence/fssetup).

> [!WARNING]
>
> * This package is intend for my own use and none of the functions or features have been tested for widespread use.
> * As this was not intended for widespread use, the code underlying these functions is not pretty.
